# Knowledge Graph-Based Counter-Narrative Generation

## Abstract
This project investigates how episodic knowledge graphs can be utilized to generate effective counter-narratives (CN) in response to hate speech (HS).

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and resources for our research on knowledge graph-based counter-narrative generation. The project focuses on leveraging episodic knowledge graphs to create effective counter-narratives against hate speech.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the dialo CONAN dataset for analysis and model training. The dataset is located in the `data` folder, and the `match_conan.py` script handles preprocessing.

## Technical Setup

### Environment Setup
1. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name kg-counter-narratives python=3.9
   conda activate kg-counter-narratives
   ```

2. Run the install script:
   ```bash
   python install.py
   ```

### Execution
To run the project, use the following command:
```bash
./pipeline.sh
```
