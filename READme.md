# Knowledge Graph-Based Counter-Narrative Generation

## Project Description
This research project investigates how episodic knowledge graphs can be utilized to generate effective counter-narratives (CN) in response to hate speech (HS).

## Dataset
This project utilizes the CONAN dataset for analysis and model training. The dataset is located in the `data` folder, and the `match_conan.py` script handles preprocessing.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project environment:

1. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```
   conda create --name kg-counter-narratives python=3.8
   conda activate kg-counter-narratives
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the install script:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```
